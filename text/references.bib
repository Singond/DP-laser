	abstract = {This work provides a theoretical basis for a partially
		saturated regime of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).
		The partially saturated LIF regime, where the dependence of the
		fluorescence signal on the laser-power is non-linear,
		benefits from higher signal-to-noise ratio at the cost of more
		complex measurement evaluation when compared to the typically
		used linear regime.
		Starting from a well-established three-level model,
		and considering a realistic temporal and spatial profile of the
		laser pulse, approximate formulas were found that describe the
		dependence of fluorescence signal on laser pulse energy in commonly
		used experimental arrangements.
		These formulas can be used to determine absolute concentration from
		partially saturated LIF measurements.
		This method was applied to the atomic lead measurement and to the
		study of the decomposition of lead hydride in various versions
		of flames.}
