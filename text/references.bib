    abstract = {We present an optical electric field measurement method
		for use in high pressure plasma discharges.
		The method is based upon the field induced second harmonic generation
		technique and can be used for localized electric field measurements
		with sub-nanosecond resolution in any gaseous species.
		When an external electric field is present, a dipole is induced
		in the typically centrosymmetric medium, allowing for second harmonic
		generation with signal intensities which scale by the square of the
		electric field.
		Calibrations have been carried out in 100 Torr room air,
		and a minimum sensitivity of 450 V/cm is demonstrated.
		Measurements were performed with nanosecond or faster temporal
		resolution in a 100 Torr room air environment both with and
		without a plasma present.
		It was shown that with no plasma present, the field follows
		the applied voltage to gap ratio, as measured using the back
		current shunt method.
		When the electric field is strong enough to exceed the breakdown
		threshold, the measured field was shown to exceed the anticipated
		voltage to gap ratio which is taken as an indication of the
		ionization wave front as it sweeps through the plasma volume.},

		The electric field is determined using four different methods:
		laser-aided electric field induced second harmonics (EFISH),
		optical emission-based first negative/second positive systems
		(FNS/SPSs of molecular nitrogen) intensity ratio, electrical
		equivalent circuit approach and via determination of the
		Townsend first coefficient from the spatial optical emission profile.
		The resulting values of the electric field obtained by these
		respective methods, regardless of the differences in absolute values,
		lie within a reasonable range.
		The limitations and advantages of all methods are discussed
		in detail for the investigated discharge.
		The EFISH measurements are supported by re-computation of the
		effective interaction-path of the laser using an electrostatic model.
		The FNS/SPS method provides systematically higher values compared
		to other methods.
		We discuss in detail the potential origin of this discrepancy,
		as this method is at the limit of its applicability due to the
		low E/N values and we also consider the impossibility of full
		verification of the underlying assumptions.
		The focused discussion addresses best-practice issues and
		identifies possible future steps to improve each of the
		four methods under given conditions.}

		The partially saturated LIF regime, where the dependence of the
		fluorescence signal on the laser-power is non-linear,
		benefits from higher signal-to-noise ratio at the cost of more
		complex measurement evaluation when compared to the typically
		used linear regime.
		Starting from a well-established three-level model,
		and considering a realistic temporal and spatial profile of the
		laser pulse, approximate formulas were found that describe the
		dependence of fluorescence signal on laser pulse energy in commonly
		used experimental arrangements.
		These formulas can be used to determine absolute concentration from
		partially saturated LIF measurements.
		This method was applied to the atomic lead measurement and to the
		study of the decomposition of lead hydride in various versions
		of flames.}
