	abstract = {We investigate the electric field development in weak
		microseconds-lasting atmospheric pressure Townsend discharge
		operated in a barrier discharge arrangement in pure nitrogen.
		The electric field is determined using four different methods:
		laser-aided electric field induced second harmonics (EFISH),
		optical emission-based first negative/second positive systems
		(FNS/SPSs of molecular nitrogen) intensity ratio, electrical
		equivalent circuit approach and via determination of the
		Townsend first coefficient from the spatial optical emission profile.
		The resulting values of the electric field obtained by these
		respective methods, regardless of the differences in absolute values,
		lie within a reasonable range.
		The limitations and advantages of all methods are discussed
		in detail for the investigated discharge.
		The EFISH measurements are supported by re-computation of the
		effective interaction-path of the laser using an electrostatic model.
		The FNS/SPS method provides systematically higher values compared
		to other methods.
		We discuss in detail the potential origin of this discrepancy,
		as this method is at the limit of its applicability due to the
		low E/N values and we also consider the impossibility of full
		verification of the underlying assumptions.
		The focused discussion addresses best-practice issues and
		identifies possible future steps to improve each of the
		four methods under given conditions.}

	abstract = {This work provides a theoretical basis for a partially
		saturated regime of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).
		The partially saturated LIF regime, where the dependence of the
		fluorescence signal on the laser-power is non-linear,
		benefits from higher signal-to-noise ratio at the cost of more
		complex measurement evaluation when compared to the typically
		used linear regime.
		Starting from a well-established three-level model,
		and considering a realistic temporal and spatial profile of the
		laser pulse, approximate formulas were found that describe the
		dependence of fluorescence signal on laser pulse energy in commonly
		used experimental arrangements.
		These formulas can be used to determine absolute concentration from
		partially saturated LIF measurements.
		This method was applied to the atomic lead measurement and to the
		study of the decomposition of lead hydride in various versions
		of flames.}
