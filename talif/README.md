TALIF
=====
Two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence.

Setup
=====
Krypton excited by laser tuned to about 204.1 nm
(see precise wavelengths below or in appropriate directories).
The fluorescence wavelength peak is at about 826.3 nm.
Imaged by and ICCD camera equipped with a bandpass filter `LC-826BP5-50`
(maximum transmittance around 826 nm).
