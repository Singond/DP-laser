TALIF measurement 2022-08-04
============================

Finding the optimal wavelength
------------------------------
`wavelen-1`: Wavelength is varied from 204 nm to 204.3 nm with step 0.01 nm.
TALIF observed in frames 12--17, maximum signal attained in frame 14.

`wavelen-2`: The same with finer wavelength values from 204.05 nm to 204.25 nm
at step 0.005 nm.
Maximum attained in frame 17, corresponding to wavelength of 204.13 nm.

Saturation
----------
Wavelength set to 204.13 nm, laser amplification increased from about 12
to maximum (50).
Power is changed every one or two camera frames and measured by a powermeter.
With higher amplification, the laser beam gets wider.

`saturation-1`: The powermeter reading does not increase linearly,
but becomes saturated instead.
At higher amplifications, the beam is wider than the powermeter aperture,
decreasing the ratio of detected power to total power.

`saturation-2`: Added an iris before the glass chamber and lens to keep the beam
at constant width. Did not help, there was still some power saturation.

`saturation-3`: Same setup, power increased every two camera frames,
then going down (after every frame?).
